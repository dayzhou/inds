### Introduction

This is the "ICTS Number Distributing System" (**INDS**). I designed this for distributing inner publication numbers to researchers in my research center. But it can also be used as a template and starting point for other similar systems. It is light-weight, and the underlying engine is __Python__ + __webpy__ + __MySQL__.

You can see some snapshots in the __snapshots__ folder.
